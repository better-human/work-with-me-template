# Manifest

Here is a draft for a self-describing methodology that may help people ending up on your Github profile to have a better understanding of who you are and maybe bring on the urge to get in touch with you! :-)

In fact, bringing your 'true self' at work seems to be a goal for more and more of us and I'm confident that being able to do that would lead in more honnest and peaceful relationships and finally in a general well being.

This methodology thus aims at describing who your true self is and let people know so that they have a better glimpse of who you are before they begin to work with you

## Usage

- Fork this repo
- rename it in Settings to `work-with-me`
- replace all sections of first `Work with me` section with your own stuff
- remove the `Manifest` section
- remove the `Side Notes` section
- if you have another job you're in and you want to submit a template for, go ahead
- if you want to add yourself to the list of users already using this methodology

*Of course, all of these sections are proposals and can be removed/modified if you feel this is odd, irrelevant or unappropriate*

## Why did I create this

After reading a post of Katie Womersley from Buffer on [Why and How to share your Manager README](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b), I got really inspired because I would love to be able to tell, right upfront, if I am more likely to get along with my potential future workmates by having access to their own description of themselves (and not only my manager :-).
This comes along with my will to “bring my true self at work” as described by Philippe Laloux in his awesome talk on [Reinventing organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS04BI2sbk&feature=youtu.be)

# Work with me

Here is an attempt to describe who you are in a public area

## One sentence to describe myself

It is a very difficult exercise to summarize a complex human being but this can help you focus on what really is the most important about you

## Values

As awesome companies like Buffer or Zapier states, values really describe what is the most important for you.
And this is what people who will want to work with you may really care about.

## Family

Being single, married, divorced with 5 kids affects the way you live and handle things.
That's something that usually come up in an interview meeting and as such, belongs here.

## Personality

This is one of the most difficult part, describe who you are to work with.
Doer, ego/no-ego, need for acknowledgment of your work, ...
Well anything that would help the reader to know you better.

## Work environment

Talk about your sweet spot, where you actually get work done.
As Zapier, you can share the optimal temperature of your office or your perfect.
At Automattic, you show where you work from https://officetoday.wordpress.com.

## The most exiting thing you've acomplished/lived

You've been awesome once, let them know.

## Hobbies

One more thing you can find chemistry about.

## Readings

Tell me what You read and I'll tell who who you are.
You can here write down:
- your favorite book
- your current book
- one book that changed your life

## Social media activity

Here you can tell if you share every part of your life or if you share fewer things or not at all.

## Jobs I can do

Maybe you have a lot of hats (french expression sorry :-)) and can do multiple things. he you can describe what capes you can wear as your next superhero's job.

- [Frontend developer](./frontend-developer.md)
- [Backend developer](./backend-developer.md)
- [Product owner](./product-owner.md)
- [Team leader/Manager](./team-leader-manager.md)
- Create your own...

## Find me on the web

You sure have a lot of social profiles that might be intereting for people who want to get in touch with you, it can also lead to ice breaking discussions if you share a common passion.
